        <p>Whenever I fly back to Providence, I use Boston Airport Cab to book a car from Boston's Logan Airport to Providence. However, I often find myself confused with the online reservation process.
          <br> <br>So I thought it would be a valuable UI/UX task to look at the reservation webpage and ...
          <br> 
          <ol>
            <li> Analyze its usability</li>
            <li>Redesign the webpage with a lo-fi and hi-fi prototype</li>
            <li>Implement a responsive redesign</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      
      <h5>Low-Fidelity (Balsamiq Wireframes 3)</h5>

      <p>The biggest change was the omission of unnecessary information. Users click on the make a reservation link with the intention of making a
        reservation. Therefore in the redesign, I focussed on the form, where users fill select options for their reservation. In this design, the user
         should be able to use the form without additional instruction.  </p>
         <p>If the user is a first time user and therefore wants to learn more about child-seats, vehicles, and stopovers, the menu links are
          accessible at the top of the for further information. With this design, returning users and focus making the booking, and only use
           the menu links if needed. </p>

      <h3>Hi-Fidelity (Figma)</h3>
      <p>The hi-fi prototypes look pretty much like the lo-fi prototypes. I focussed on keeping the colours and look very simple.
        The orange works as an accent colour for the buttons and progress bar. The navy blue works as the main colour.

      <h2>Responsive Webpage Implementation</h2>
      <p>Using Flex Box and Bootstrap, I was able to implement the redesign of the page in HTML and CSS. You'll notice that in this redesign, the user is able to easily change options without having to restart their reservation.

  <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
  <p>From this task, I was able to address the usability issues that I personally found whenever I used BostonAirportCab to book my ride back to Providence. 
    I found usability analysis and prototyping, so valuable in making a stronger usable webpage. As a frequent user, I'd love to see BostonAirportCab implement 
    a design like this so that I can personally enjoy the pleasant user experience that matches up to the great rider experience I have. </p>
